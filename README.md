rmaze
=====

rmaze is a web service that generates a random maze, and then solves it. "Why would you do this?", you might ask. The answer: for fun!

Usage
-----

The easiest way to run this locally is with [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen):

    lein deps
    lein ring server

There's a demo running [here](http://rmaze.joshfleming.com).
